# sbx_API_FlaskRestPlus
Evaluation for using FlaskRestPlus for the Web Framework for the Sandbox API. 

This repo contains a sample API Framework to be evaluated. This Application is build with Flask and the Flask-Rest-Plus plugin. Documentation can be found here http://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


This basic code was leveraged from the foosball demo, and so you may see some leftover foosball python files in here. If we decide to go with flask-restplus we will start from scratch. 

Go into the sandobx_api folder to find the main code for the application. The code is currently running python 3.5. The application can be invoked by running app.py. 

Check out sandobx_api/api/blog/endpoints to see the python files associated to each endpoint. For example, all functions related to the "sandbox" endpoint can be found in sandbox.py.
